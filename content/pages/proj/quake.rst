Overview
--------

Port of ID software's classic Quake_ to the Palm Pre.  Straightforward port, made news because it was the first homebrew app that used the native 3D libraries, before the PDK was released publicly.

Recognition
-----------

Mentioned on news sites such as Slashdot_ and Engadget_.

The youtube videos there are of an early beta, unfortunately they weren't updated when a stable release was made.
