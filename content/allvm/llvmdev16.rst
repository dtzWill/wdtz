Around two years ago I attended the 2016 LLVM Developer's Meeting
and led a "Birds of a Feather" (BoF) discussion on the topic
of shipping software as LLVM IR.  The objective was to bring out
all the parties who are clearly doing so already or interested in doing so
and to try to find ways to work together.

I'll hopefully write more about this in the future,
but for now here's a short post about this event as well as
a link to the slides used for the discussion.

Slides
------
The `slides`_ worked well, and I should have posted them long ago.

Thanks

The BoF was very well attended and I would likely have been overwhelmed
by all the ideas and suggestions were it not for a number of
fellow UIUC folks (all part of the ALLVM team) who stepped up to
take notes, handle the whiteboard, and help guide and answer questions.

This was also an opportunity to tell the community about ALLVM,
which was well-enough received for a project still underway :).
