Today finally got rid of my old '89 Buick Century, sold off for parts.

Memorial post to my first and well-loved car follows.

PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

Here's to you, ol' faithful.  Pictures taken right before it
got hauled off to the scrapyard in the sky.  Err, down the
street.

We've been through a lot, old friend!  You'll be missed!

The Beginning
-------------

Buick was born in Springfield, and was lucky enough
to attend WUSTL in its youth before settling down
with good folk in Chambana.  A conservative car,
it only had two owners in its life.

I met Buick when I was looking to sell my old TV
and my friend was looking to find a good home
for it.  Seeing a mutually beneficial opportunity,
a trade was arranged.

It's amusing to notice it all started with
a car and TV upgrade: this time I'm finding myself
with a new car and passing on the Buick, and friend
I got it from just upgraded to a new TV.


Oh the Places You've Gone
-------------------------

* Many trips to WI
* Many trips down to southern IL

This past summer, we gave the Buick one last
hurrah and drove down to St. Louis for a weekend
vacation, even stopping off at its birthplace on
the return trip.  As always, it served us well.

The Last Days
-------------

Other than a minor altenator replacement a few
years ago, Buick always hid its age well.
However, recently it started to show signs
that its time has come:

* Driver-side door doesn't close properly
* Repair shop borked R12->R134A upgrade, killing A/C
* Blinker unit broken, apparently non-trivially to fix (??)
* Large piece of undercarriage fell off in WI somewhere
* Rear-view mirror fell off
* Original hubcaps stolen, attempted to steal car (lots of interior damage)
* Gas mileage plummeted
* Rust creeping everywhere

So the decision was made to move on and let Buick
rest in peace (pieces?).  Also, the safety of
driving it was rather questionable at this
point...

A New Chapter
-------------

Replacing the old car is one of many changes I've
been making lately, an easy example being this website.

That said, the old adage about old friends being
gold comes to mind and indeed there are good
things about the previous chapter that will be
missed.

As they say, your first love^H^H^H^Hcar will always
have a special place in your heart... :)

So with that, I say:

  So long, and thanks for all the fish!
